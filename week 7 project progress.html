<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">If you are interested in joining a Social Motorcycle Club and enjoy some comradery, meeting new people and the freedom that only motorcycles can offer why not message us or get in contact with one of our members <br>
MMSMC excepts all types of bikes but you must be able to ride comfortably at given speed limits, also our lady members are always on the lookout for more female riders or pillions <br>
MMSMC all our rides are organised by members that include local, overnight and interstate, members are encouraged to organise a ride throughout the year to a destination of their choice 
MMSMC is a Social Club <br> and while we encourage people to join in on rides as much as possible, we also understand that family and work commitments come first 
MMSMC is committed to helping local and charitable events within the community <br>
If MMSMC sounds like something you would like more information on or would like to meet us please reach out 
<br>Regards, Munity Mob</p>
